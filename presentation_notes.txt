problem introduction/background:
	part-of-speech (PoS) tagging is a well-known natural language processing (NLP) problem
	given a sentence, assign a PoS tag to each word in the sentence
		"word" may be loosely-used depending on language
	difference from typical classification task: requires context
		words can be different parts of speech (do different things) depending on where they are in the sentence and what is around them
		Noun-Verb:
			"spot"
			"Your nose has a spot on it." (N) vs "Can you spot him?" (V)
		Noun-Adjective:
			"red"
			"The red I like is that one." (N) vs "The red car has arrived." (A)
	uses of PoS tagging:
		machine translation
		word sense disambiguation (semantic analysis - which meaning is this word representing?)
		named entity recognition ("New York" is a name, and not related to new things in York)
